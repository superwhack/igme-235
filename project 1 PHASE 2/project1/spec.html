As you can see in this expanded Epic New gallery, the variety in the new Squeebs is tremendous, even at this early stage of development. (In Japan, this game is known as Mother Nature 3. There was a Family Computer game that never came out on the PC and Mother Nature 2, which appeared as MarsLinked for the Super PC.)</p>

                <p class = "mainText" id="mainText2"> We don't know much about the game's plot at this point, but it does involve many of the characters from the original Super PC game, including Reigns and the squeecies of big-nosed Squeebs known as Squaturns. We exect the new Squeebs to have even more of an incremental feel because of its feature-rich menu-based world. Currently scheduled for release on the Super Duper PC following the release of Green Man Adventure 64, Ultra Squeebs 64 most likely won't arrive in North America until sometime next semester.

If you're wonder-ing where all the wonderful images come from, it is from the BEE group at Squeeb Ltd in Rochester. Director of Ultra Squeebs 99, Beeatrice H. Azaelia, even provided us with his rough sketches of possible characters and scenes for the game. One thing we've learned from studying these pictures is that Ultra Squeebs 99 is bound to be a marvel of the imagination.</p>
