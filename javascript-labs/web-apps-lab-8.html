// For this exercise you will use Array.filter(), Array.sort(), and Array.map() on
// the cars array above.

/*
 1 - Create a new array named 'classicCars' that contains only those cars with a
 .year of 1970 or earlier. Use Array.filter() on the cars array:
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
*/

classicCars = cars.filter(car => car.year <= 1970);

/*
 2 - Create a new array named 'sortedByYear' that contains the contents of the
 car array, sorted by .year, ascending (oldest to most recent)
 Use Array.sort() on the cars array - and read about writing a comparison function here:
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
 
*/
sortedByYear = cars.sort((car, car2) => car.year - car2.year );

/*
 3 - Create a new array named 'newerYearsOnly' that contains only the .year property 
 (not the entire car object) of those cars that are .year 2010 or newer. 
 Use Array.map() on the cars array:
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
 
 This will give you a few undefined values. Use Array.filter() to get rid of these 
 undefined values so that newerYearsOnly contains only years (Numbers)
 
 Hint: you could use Number.isInteger() or the typeof operator:
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
 
 You could do this additional filter on a separate filter on the different lines,
 or as a "one-liner" by chaining the method calls.
