As you can see in this expanded Epic New gallery, the variety in the new Ultra Squeebs 99 is tremendous, even at this early stage of development. (In Japan, this game is known as Mother Nature 3. There was a Family Computer game that never came out on the PC</p>

                <p class = "mainText" id="mainText2">  and Mother Nature 2, which appeared as MarsLinked for the Super PC.) We don't know much about the game's plot at this point, but we have seen many of its characters, including Remsy and the squeecies of big-nosed Squeebs known as Squaturns. We exect the new Ultra Squeebs 99 to be an incremental game with a feature-rich menu-based world. Currently scheduled for release on the Super Duper PC following the release of Green Man Adventure 64, </p>

                <p class="mainText" id="mainText3"> Ultra Squeebs 99 most likely won't arrive in North America until sometime next semester. It may seem like a long time to wait, but the promise of a game with this many bespoke mechanics should keep players waiting anxiously. Director of Ultra Squeebs 99, Bee Morse, even provided us with her rough sketches of possible characters and scenes for the game. One thing we've learned from studying these pictures is that Ultra Squeebs 99 is bound to be a marvel of the imagination.</p>
